	<h1>Hi! I'm Althea B. Palatino <33</h1>
    <p>I'm 21 yrs old currently taking of BS of Computer Science at Emilio Aguinaldo College - Cavite</p>
    <p>My hobby is make-up. Because that way, I appreciate myself more and that's one of the things that boosts my confidence. I also like to write poems, especially when I'm in a lot of pain, I just write them using poetry. I also like to explore things. And I am most proud of my passion for leading. The satisfaction is different when I see the result of my leadership.</p>
